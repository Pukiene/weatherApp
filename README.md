Weather app has strengths and weaknesses. It works without any significant problems and is swift, as expected. It is a simple app because the amount of code is small. It requests only four lines of code and is an app function. All information for the app does not request any resources and comes from the server for free. The weather app requests only a web browser.  
However, the weather app has weaknesses that arise every time the refreshed app pings the open weather map, and if it is done multiple times, it will also have multiple pins in Germany. This does not cause us a big problem most of the time because our location is close to Germany, but if we try to refresh this action for her from a further location like America, it may cause interference.
All information is taken from one server. If something happens to the server, the app will not work and will be unavailable. OpenWeatherMap API have uptime (web services) which is 95%, which means that 5% of the time app will not work. The app is entirely reliant on that OpenWeatherMap API to be functional.
OpenWeatherMap API also gives for free only 60 goals per minute, one goal per second. It would be appropriate for an app with a small user flow. However, the OpenWeatherMap API will apply server usage fees if there is a more significant user flow.
